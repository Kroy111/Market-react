			"Marvel, Jurassic World Star Scarlett Johansson Joins Mike Flanagan's New Exorcist Movie",
		news: `Marvel and Jurassic World: Rebirth star Scarlett Johansson has signed on to appear in the new Exorcist movie from horror writer and director Mike Flanagan.
    
      Last year, it was reported that Flanagan, who led the charge on Doctor Sleep, The Haunting of Hill House, and The Fall of the House of Usher, was creating the new Exorcist film with Blumhouse. At the time it was described as a “radical new take” for the series.

      The Exorcist, released in 1973, is about the demonic possession of 12-year-old Regan MacNeil, played by Linda Blair, whose mother, a famous actress, seeks help from two Catholic priests after medical and psychological treatments fail. One is a skeptical young priest, Father Karras, the other an experienced exorcist, Father Merrin. Together they perform an exorcism to save Regan from the demonic entity.`,

		title: `Harry Potter's Full Cast Audible Drama is Out Now, and You Can Listen for Less Than £1`,
		news: `The Harry Potter series is Audible’s most high-profile, full-cast audio production to date by far. But, you may have already seen snippets of other immersive audio productions this year doing the rounds on socials. The added production elements, including ambient effects and real-world sound capture, such as the clanging of swords, and dramatic music, are a good example of what’s been attracting readers to seek out alternative ways of consuming their favourite media.


      That’s no different here, from the echo of footsteps in the Great Hall to the crack of a spell in motion, every sound draws you further into the world, creating an experience that feels utterly real, and leaving you completely immersed.`,

		title: `Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 System Update 21.0.1 Available — Here Are the Patch Notes`,
		news: `Nintendo has issued a fresh system software update for the Switch and Switch 2, bringing both consoles' firmware up to Version 21.0.1.

      The latest patch arrives just two weeks after Nintendo's last major update to its console firmware, which was also widely criticized for appearing to break compatibility with a range of third-party Switch 2 docks. Nintendo, for its part, said in a subsequent statement to IGN that it had no "intention to hinder or invalidate legal third-party dock compatibility."

      Today's update is only just landing now, and there are numerous third-party dock options out there to test. But, so far, there's been no immediate suggestion from fans that this update has made further changes to third-party dock compatibility — for better or worse. Still, we'll keep an eye and update if we spot anything of note.`,
